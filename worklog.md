# IT Asset Manager - Project Worklog

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive IT Asset Management system based on the wireframe provided.
- **Stack**: Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Prisma (SQLite)
- **Key Feature**: Image-to-Text (OCR) using VLM skill for "Add via Image" flow
- **Entities**: AssetType, Department, Location, Person, Asset, AssignmentHistory, AssetImage, ActivityLog

Task ID: 1
Agent: Main (orchestrator)
Task: Set up Prisma schema with all entities and push to DB

Work Log:
- Read the wireframe markdown file to understand requirements
- Defined comprehensive Prisma schema with 8 models (AssetType, Department, Location, Person, Asset, AssignmentHistory, AssetImage, ActivityLog)
- Asset model includes: basic info, hardware specs, mobile-specific fields, peripherals, assignment links
- Attempted prisma db push but engine download from binaries.prisma.sh is extremely slow/failing
- Downloading prisma engines (libquery_engine + schema-engine) manually via curl with resume

Stage Summary:
- Schema is complete at prisma/schema.prisma
- Prisma engine download in progress (slow network to binaries.prisma.sh)
- Will retry db push once engines are in place

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main (orchestrator)
Task: Switch to node:sqlite (Node built-in) instead of Prisma, build data layer + all API routes + frontend views

Work Log:
- Prisma engine download was too unreliable (binaries.prisma.sh connection keeps dropping)
- Discovered Node v24 has built-in `node:sqlite` (DatabaseSync) — no engine downloads needed!
- Rewrote `src/lib/db.ts` to use node:sqlite with full schema (8 tables: AssetType, Department, Location, Person, Asset, AssignmentHistory, AssetImage, ActivityLog)
- Updated package.json dev script to use `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-sqlite`
- Created `src/lib/seed.ts` with comprehensive demo data (7 asset types, 8 departments, 5 locations, 10 persons, 22 assets)
- Created `src/lib/repo.ts` — full data access layer (assetTypeRepo, departmentRepo, locationRepo, personRepo, assetRepo, historyRepo, imageRepo, getDashboardStats)
- Created `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/lib/format.ts`, `src/lib/api.ts` (frontend API client), `src/lib/nav.ts` (Zustand navigation store)
- Built ALL API routes: /api/dashboard, /api/assets (CRUD + assign + history + images), /api/asset-types, /api/departments, /api/locations, /api/persons, /api/ocr (VLM-powered), /api/ocr/[imageId], /api/import (CSV), /api/seed, /api/images/[imageId]
- Built frontend: AppShell (sidebar + header + sticky footer), ThemeToggle, Providers
- Built 11 view components: DashboardView, AssetsListView, AssetDetailView, AssetFormView, OcrUploadView, DepartmentsView, LocationsView, PersonsView, AssetTypesView, ImportView, ReportsView
- Main page (`src/app/page.tsx`) has SPA view router with auto-seed on first load
- OCR flow uses z-ai-web-dev-sdk VLM to extract asset fields from images, pre-fills the asset form
- Currently waiting for `npm install` to complete (downloading packages — network is very slow, ~650MB cached so far, next binary not yet extracted)

Stage Summary:
- ALL code is written and ready — just needs `npm install` to finish to get the `next` binary
- Using node:sqlite instead of Prisma (no engine download needed)
- 11 views + 20+ API routes implemented
- VLM OCR integration complete
- Waiting on npm install to start the dev server for verification
